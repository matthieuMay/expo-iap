## Need Help?

We are committed to providing the best possible support to our community. If you're facing any issues or have questions, here are the best ways to get help:

### GitHub Issues

For bug reports, feature requests, or any other issues with the library, please check our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/hyochan/expo-iap/issues). You can see if someone has already reported a similar issue or open a new one.

### Slack Community

For real-time communication and a more interactive support experience, we highly recommend joining our [Slack community](https://hyo.dev/joinSlack). Here you can chat with the developers and other users, get quick answers to your questions, and share your experiences. **This is the fastest way to get in touch with us.**

### Who is using expo-iap?

We love to see what you're building with `expo-iap`! If you're using our library in your app, please consider sharing it with the community in our GitHub discussion thread: [Who is using expo-iap?](https://github.com/hyochan/expo-iap/discussions/143).

Showcasing your app is a great way to inspire other developers and it's also a huge motivation for us. It helps us understand how the library is being used and how we can make it better. We appreciate your support!
