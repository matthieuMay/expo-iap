title: v3.0.3 â€” type parity with react-native-iap
tags: [release, types]
---

Synchronizes the Expo IAP TypeScript surface with [react-native-iap #3006](https://github.com/hyochan/react-native-iap/pull/3006) and refreshes our docs/examples accordingly.

Highlights

- Types: adopt `ProductSubscription`, StoreKit `ProductTypeIOS`, and optional purchase metadata fields to match upstream.
- Errors: convert helpers and guides to the camelCase `ErrorCode` members for consistent enums across platforms.
- Docs & examples: update subscription flows to the new types while keeping older versioned docs historically accurate.
