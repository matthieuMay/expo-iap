Key updates:

- Regenerated the OpenIAP schema and migrated examples/tests to the new `ProductIOS`/`PurchaseIOS` naming.
- Upgraded `PurchaseError` to extend `Error`, tightened platform typing, and normalized Android acknowledgement responses.
- Refreshed iOS docs to use platform-specific purchase requests and current `ErrorCode` identifiers.
- Build: Adopt [openiap-gql 1.0.0](https://github.com/hyodotdev/openiap-gql/releases/tag/1.0.0) for the transport layer to stay aligned with the GraphQL contract shipped across the ecosystem.

Thanks for shipping feedback that helped shape this tidy release!
