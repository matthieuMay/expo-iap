slug: v2-9-1
title: v2.9.1 â€” iOS fixes and error improvements
tags: [ios, errors, docs]
---

This patch release focuses on iOS shape alignment, error robustness, and small docs/dependency tweaks.

Highlights:

- iOS: `getPromotedProductIOS` now returns a full serialized Product; `subscriptionStatusIOS` returns `{ state, renewalInfo? }` with a real boolean `willAutoRenew`.
- Errors: expanded codes + friendlier messages; support object-style `new PurchaseError({ ... })` (positional args still work).
- Docs: Docusaurus supports GitHub Pages via dynamic `baseUrl`; added conventions for `PurchaseError` construction.
- Example iOS: pin `openiap` to `1.1.7` from git to avoid trunk lag.

Thanks for the feedback that helped shape this release!
