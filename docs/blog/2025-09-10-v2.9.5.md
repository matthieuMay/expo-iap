title: v2.9.5 — Pin openiap and deprecate 2.9.0–2.9.4
tags: [ios, cocoaPods, stability]
---

This patch release finalizes iOS stability by pinning the `openiap` CocoaPods dependency to a known-good version and formally deprecates earlier 2.9.x builds that could resolve unintended pod versions.

Highlights:

- iOS: Podspec now pins `openiap` to `1.1.9` to avoid version drift during `pod install`.
- Deprecated `2.9.0`–`2.9.4`. Please upgrade to `2.9.5`.

Upgrade notes:

- After updating to `2.9.5`, run `npx expo prebuild -p ios` (if applicable) and then `pod install` (or `pod install --repo-update` if your CDN cache is stale).
- If you previously saw random OpenIAP pod versions resolve, this release eliminates that by pinning.

Thanks for bearing with the CocoaPods ecosystem quirks — this release should make installs predictable again.
