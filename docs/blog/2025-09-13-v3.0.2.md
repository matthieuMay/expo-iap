tags: [release, ios]

Fixes an iOS Swift compile error that affected EAS builds.

<!-- truncate -->

## Changes

- iOS: Fix “cannot convert value of type '[[String : Any?]]'” by returning non‑optional dictionaries from the Expo bridge and removing double‑serialization in `showManageSubscriptionsIOS`.
- Examples: Use fire‑and‑forget `requestPurchase` with guards for test/mock environments.
- Hook: Dedupe purchase success events across re‑mounts to avoid duplicate logs in development.
