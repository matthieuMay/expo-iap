title: v2.9.6 — Fix Metro import resolution in useIAP
tags: [metro, bundling, react-native, expo]
---

This release fixes a Metro bundling issue that could crash apps when using `useIAP()` under certain project setups.

Symptoms:

```
Unable to resolve "../../.." from "node_modules/expo-iap/build/useIAP.js"

Metro has encountered an error: While trying to resolve module `../../..` ...
Indeed, none of these files exist.
```

What changed:

- Replaced an ambiguous `import '.'` with an explicit `import './index'` inside the hook implementation. This prevents Metro from walking up to your app root and incorrectly attempting to resolve entries like `expo-router/entry`.

Who is affected:

- Apps that saw the above error when adding `useIAP()` or after upgrading from older versions.

How to upgrade:

- Update to `expo-iap@2.9.6`, then clear cache: `npx expo start -c` (or start Metro with `--reset-cache`).

Workaround if you cannot upgrade immediately:

- Patch `node_modules/expo-iap/build/useIAP.js` to change `from '.'` → `from './index'`, then clear cache.

No runtime behavior changes are included in this release — it strictly fixes bundling resolution.
