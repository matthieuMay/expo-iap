## Key updates

- Standardized OpenIAP string unions to `'in-app'`, `'ios'`, and `'android'`, updated `useIAP` request helpers to the new `PurchaseRequestInput`, and synced docs, examples, and tests with the latest schema terminology.
- Regenerated `src/types.ts` from `openiap-gql` 1.0.2, tightened the contributor workflow around type generation, and excluded the file from Prettier/ESLint churn.
- Bumped the Android fallback to [openiap-google 1.1.10](https://github.com/hyodotdev/openiap-google/releases/tag/1.1.10) and the iOS pod to [openiap 1.1.12](https://github.com/hyodotdev/openiap-apple/releases/tag/1.1.12) while adopting PascalCase error codes and the revised request parameter models across the native bridges and config plugin.

Thanks for testing the schema churn quickly—your reports keep the hosted APIs and this wrapper aligned.
