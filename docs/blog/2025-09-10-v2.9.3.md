title: v2.9.3 â€” iOS error fixes and CocoaPods hardening
tags: [ios, bugfix, cocoaPods]

This patch release fixes iOS compile/runtime issues introduced around error typing and improves CocoaPods reliability.

Highlights:

- iOS: replace thrown `OpenIapError.*` usages and nonexistent event types with proper `OpenIapFailure` cases
- iOS: rely on type inference for error event listener to avoid missing type symbols
- Plugin(iOS): ensure Podfile includes GitHub Specs before CDN and add stability envs to reduce CDN HTTP/2 flakiness
- Plugin(iOS): apply the same improvements when injecting a local `openiap` pod for development

Upgrade notes:

- If you hit CocoaPods CDN errors, try `pod install --repo-update` or temporarily pin `openiap` in your app Podfile. The plugin will now add GitHub Specs as a fallback automatically on prebuild.
